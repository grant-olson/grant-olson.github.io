description: An in-depth tutorial for Stackless Python
---

This is a tutorial on Stackless Python. It is available in html and
pdf formats. Code is included in the text, and in a standalone zip
archive. Most examples should run as-is on a working install of
Stackless Python 2.4.3, except for the samples in the chapter on
actors, which require that [pyGame](http://www.pygame.org) be
installed for the visualization engine.

The tutorial was written in reStructuredText.  The
[source](https://github.com/grant-olson/why_stackless) is available on
github if anyone would like to update the tutorial to use more recent
versions of python.

In addition, some kind soul translated the [tutorial into
Chinese](http://islab.org/stackless/2007/stackless.html).
