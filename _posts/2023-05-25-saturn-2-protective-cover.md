title: Elegoo Saturn 2 - Do I remove the "Please press firmly on the build plate when tightening the screws" film?

**TLDR: Do you remove the film that says "Please press firmly on the build plate when tightening the screws"? YES**

I started up a new firmware job at PomSafe a few months ago. Our
products are small and have some detailing that isn't suitable for my
normal FDM 3D printers. I decided to finally break down and get a resin
printer, which I had been putting off because I wasn't sure how messy and
dangerous the resin would be.

I went with an Elegoo Saturn 2. When I first got it the instructions
were good about indicating what plastic needed to be removed on the
vat, but there was a piece of plastic on the build plate that said
"Please press firmly on the build plate when tightening the screws". I
wasn't sure if this was supposed to be there or not. I tried picking
at it a little with my finger and thumb to see if it was supposed to
come off. It didn't budge and it looked like it had a precision fit so
I left it on.

I had some success with printing: the Rook worked, the Cones of
Calibration and Ameralabs test print worked. But I had strange issues
where my custom STLs weren't quite sticking to the build plate. I was
able to get good prints if I, for example, used a raft and tilted the
parts at 45 degrees, and set the early layer burns to 60 seconds, and
all kinds of tweaks. To complicate things more, I've been trying to
print out Orange Pi cases and consumer products, and a lot of the
wisdom out there for these is aimed more at the tabletop miniatures
crowd.

While trying different fixes I noticed that this film was starting
peel off at the edges. So I got back to wondering if this film was
supposed to come off even though it wasn't documented anywhere.
Infuriatingly I couldn't find any pictures of the base of the build
plate on Elegoo's site to see what the installed plate was supposed to
look like. Searching on the exact term eventually got me to a few
pages on reddit forums where people were talking and saying the film
should come off.

So I'm creating this page to hopefully create something definitive
that will show high up in search results for others who have this
problem. It's a pretty simple fix, but I thought I should at least
write up a story like those annoying recipes so that the search
engines take it seriously!

Hope this helps another new Saturn 2 owner out there.
