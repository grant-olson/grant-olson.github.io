title: You Should Be Using Pogo Pin Receptacles with Pogo Pins
category: news
---

There are many articles, videos, blog posts, etc, showing you how to
use pogo pins to make programming and test fixtures for your
electronics projects. But almost all are missing one critical
component to make pogo pins work reliably: the Pogo Pin Receptacle. If
you're trying to build a fixture or jig that uses pogo pins, you
should be mounting the receptacle part to your fixture, and not
mounting the pogo pin directly.

For the generic pogo pins available on AliExpress, eBay, etc, sold
with designations like P50, P75, and P100, there are corresponding
parts R50, R75, and R100 that you will want to use. Unfortunately
these can be harder to find than the pogo pins, but it's well worth
tracking the parts down and ordering.

It is a little easier to demonstrate how they work with a live video,
so I made this one to explain how to dramatically improve both the
ease of construction and the reliability of fixtures and jigs that use
pogo pins to make contact with your PCBAs.
